✨ In Progress: Framer Frontend (Early Concept)
A Framer-based interface is currently being developed to improve accessibility and user experience.
Goals include:

Clean, distraction-free UI with mobile support

Text input with conversational layout

Integration with the Hugging Face backend (via API)

📍 Current status: UI prototype only, integration in progress

## ✨ Future Ideas

- Add conversational memory
- Store answers for journaling
- Mobile-friendly UI (Framer integration)
- Multi-language support
- More coaching “modes” (e.g. career, emotional, productivity)
